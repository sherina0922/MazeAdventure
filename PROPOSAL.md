# Project Proposal

*Basic Summary*
I wanted to create a adventure like game in which the player tries to get to the end of a maze with limited visibility and has to deal with monsters along the way. The player, before starting the game, should be able to choose a difficulty which may not necessarily change the maze formation but will limit how many spaces around the player's current position is visible. The idea is that the harder the difficulty, the less visibility. Also, the player should be able to somewhat customize their stats as fighting monsters is part of the game. Ideally, the player (when fighting the monster) should be able to make decisions like attack and defend but may be reduced to automatic battling if limitations exist. The current stats of the player would most likely be plainly visible on the side of the screen and be automatically updated as the game continues. The player would move using WASD keys. 

*Possible Libraries*
I'm not quite sure exactly which libraries I will end up using but for now...
1. ofBitmapFont
2. ofGraphics
3. ofImage

*Basic Summary*
I wanted to create a game in which the player has to point to a certain "boxes" that will appear on the screen. The idea is that the program will access the computer camera, have the player be in an ideally dark room and hold a bright colored item (white eraser, something neon/white) that will attract the "particles" on the screen, and try to get as many particles in the moving boxes. 

*Possible Libraries and References*
1. ofxOpenCv -> use to access computer camera
2. ofPoint
3. particlesExample from OF Examples -> make particles on screen
