# Development of Final Project

## 4/18/2018

### Problems / In Progress:

- Implementing camera "brightness" tracking with EasyCam
  - Camera tracking has to adjust to changing distances 
- Optimizing camera "brightness" tracking
  - Determines brightest point during each update
  - Kind of jumpy -> not super accurate and slightly laggy
- Creating a menu for player to choose settings
  - Either use ofcButton or somehow use ofDrawBitmapString with keyboard inputs or other method
- Linker errors with using static class variables 
  - Apple Linker errors -> declaring outside of class or extern works but not ideal
- Turning computer camera usage on/off
  - Always on ; need to find way to only turn on when needed
  
### Completed:

- Basic visualization of maze graphics
- EasyCam setup/works
